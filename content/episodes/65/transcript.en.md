**[0:00]** yeah well shall we get this started let's get started all right I would then welcome to those checking in to inaudible a new podcast a new production with my friend Jeremy and me Ryan and uh Jeremy what is this how would you describe this this Venture this podcast I think this is a podcast where

**[0:29]** having uh listened to your other podcasts living love and light uh and hearing these messages from the Confederation these strange beautiful messages from the Confederation on a daily basis uh it's good to uh take stock of things uh to go back and reflect uh to digest the messages uh to see what uh they have in common one of the uh ideas from Don

**[0:58]** Elkins who was one of the three people involved in nello research uh from the very beginning was that there was no scientific way he was really interested in UFO exploration uh the mystery around surrounding that and that's how I got into channeling as he got further into channeling and you know uh building a collection of his own data from all these channeling uh opportunities and sessions he realized

**[1:27]** that there was no scientific basis forever being able to you know prove anything with this stuff the only thing that uh would be useful would be the sheer amount of data collected would help us see a trend in the messages that might be helpful and that's kind of been guiding yellow research ever since given that there's so much data to go through uh I think I thought there would

**[1:54]** be some uh benefit to just reflecting on what we've been listening to this whole time uh along with you Ryan uh to see how the these uh messages get applied in our lives uh where there's confusion um and where we can see some inspiration uh to let love live our lives a little better yeah I hear you I agree I agree I think um

**[2:21]** you know I came into this being really floored to find the law of one material and then to discover that the organization that produced that material had a whole backlog and history of transcripts of of conscious channeling transcripts where the raw contact is was a trans or unconscious channeling um so yeah you start looking through the

**[2:49]** old you know the old stuff and uh well first of all first of all going into the law of one is so hard when you're coming in cold because you and you and I have talked about this before there is two decades plus of history and and ideas being being communicated and fleshed out before you get to the raw material so it's kind of hard to go in to the raw material and kind of understand what's

**[3:16]** going on and you know I remember there's multiple times in the raw material where Dawn is asking the question but if you're if you're tuned to this you you realize there's a question behind the question you realize that there's a reason he's asking because he's searching for an answer he's hoping for a specific answer and without that some of that context some of that historical context of where they're coming from you're just kind of second guessing you're like I wonder why he's

**[3:46]** asking this like he's clearly looking for a specific response here so so I I decided to go back into you know the transcript library and just start reading and I was a bit bummed that there was no there was no podcast or no you know YouTube channel I could just kind of plug in and repeat and you know so yeah so I decided to just start recording those um and I know you're much farther along in Reading those than I am I think you said

**[4:14]** you're in the 90s right now I just started 1998. holy cow see I just I think I just finished uh October 31st 1976 and and I'm I think that was session 156 plus or minus because I I combined some so I mean I've been doing this since November you know I know only a couple years in and uh holy cow there's a lot there's a lot of ways to go but what's been very interesting and I know you and I have

**[4:43]** also talked about this is how the message evolves over time the core message is the same and that is essentially we are all one you know love you know find the love in the situ in every situation um but how that how that message is is evolves over time has been just fascinating so and I know we'll get to that you know we'll certainly get to that but how did you how did you come across the law of

**[5:13]** one what was your journey or how or maybe it wasn't the law of one but how did you come into this material uh I found the law of one uh Lo research all of that via like many people via David Wilcock um in fact I worked pretty closely with him in the early Arts uh helping moderate his uh Yahoo group uh mailing list

**[5:41]** um and uh uh the more that I studied uh the raw material the more I found that that was where my real that's where I felt like the mystery really uh was located and I wanted to go into that more um so I've been studying it ever since I'd say like 2000 um and you know just doing what I can to find ways to

**[6:08]** expand that study and I think you put your finger on something that I wanted to say which is that a lot of people uh think the raw contact that LL research established in the early 80s is the Pinnacle of their channeling and I would certainly agree with that a narrowband six density contact is a very uh very hard uh

**[6:36]** standard to hit a very hard contact to make and it takes a lot of practice with channeling but what you were saying before is very very important knowing how they got tonight January 15 1981 when they made that contact consciously I might add I don't think it was a trance contact at that point um knowing the context knowing what had worked and what hadn't how they started getting their questioning away from the

**[7:05]** transient topics of Bigfoot and UFO and stuff like that and seeing them slowly over time narrow to this tight Focus that then I believe made the narrowband contact possible made the sixth density contact instead of these fourth and fifth density contacts possible is very important for people to understand and as somebody who didn't really care about the conscious channeling for a really long time

**[7:33]** um and then discovered it when I kind of had like a heart opening uh experience back in 2014 2015. uh it really grounded all of the somewhat technical sometimes maybe a little bit cold uh delivery and uh digestion that raw offers there's a lot of good meat in there but when you get the historical context when

**[8:00]** you see this in the context of uh people all around the world trying to find information that's helpful and trying to find different ways to reach out and get that information I think it makes it a much more poignant uh event in the history of channeling that when uh when raw comes in because you see that it wasn't just something that magically happened it was about a discipline and a protocol that Lo

**[8:29]** research has established unlike a lot of other channels and channeling groups uh I don't know anybody who takes channeling as seriously as hello research to this day in the way that they uh main they have uh protocols for maintaining tuning for getting into a Zone where you can do that do that channeling and do it uh reproducibly well well right yeah I'm interested to learn more about

**[8:57]** that you know know more about that but I think I think our Dynamic is going to work well because while you have been exposed to this material say two decades now I came into this I think maybe March of last year and I say March because I started meditating in March specifically I remember March because I had a I started a meditation Journal just to write notes about you know just experiences and discovery and um

**[9:26]** but I came into this maybe it's maybe a similar way but mine was through uh Tom DeLonge you know from Blink 182 Angels and Airwaves he I've gotten looking at his books up there I remember my brother gave me a call and we're always I have a twin brother and uh what I love is that a word we're identical but our personalities are just they just overlap so when he finds a book that he loves and he shares it with

**[9:55]** me I know I'm gonna love it and he told me he's like Ryan you got to read this book it's uh you know blink he gave me the whole time to long thing and he said he basically gave me an overview of the preface of his of the first book secret machines and how secret machines though it is a novel was based on true information and in the preface of the book Tom Delong goes into his his connections with you know high level military leaders and Industry leaders

**[10:24]** and long story short as I read this book loved the story and when I get on Amazon to uh to look you know to look for number two Amazon is suggesting that I also read the law of one and uh I think it it asked me it threw up that suggestion a few times before I finally just Googled it and uh and I think I came across Aaron abkey's YouTube channel where he talks about the seven densities of consciousness

**[10:54]** and you know that that concept just that whole video blew me away so I you know checked out the material um on is it law of one.net law of one dot info law of one dot info yeah where you can get the the law of one transcripts for free read them online and I just started plowing through it and and I thought secret machines was good but you know I'm like holy cow this is this is so good you know it's so deep

**[11:23]** it's so it's like it's like such a it's like a great teacher or a great book every time you go back to it you can get something else that's appropriate for you and where you're at at that time and man yeah I just loved it so but I'm very I'm interested to explore these ideas with you because you know you've had again two decades to kind of let these ideas simmer you know even if you're not consciously

**[11:52]** thinking about it they're there in the background and you have a way of subconsciously starting to process some of that stuff so I'm coming into this so new but so excited to to have discovered a a new template to of how I experience the world and how I approach challenges and you know yeah we'll get into all of that fun stuff but it's I'm just floored well for what it's worth I kind of envy you because I remember when I first discovered this stuff and how

**[12:21]** I think a friend told me it felt like putting on an old pair of worn-in shoes it's not just um the quality of the information it's the element of recognition in there that it Sparks in people who really come to love it uh there's something about it that Sparks a memory a deep memory uh and uh you can explore that as much as you want that's the great thing a lot of

**[12:50]** people uh get into quoting raw back to each other you know and getting into intellectual debates and one of the things that the conscious channeling makes very very clear is that this is not an intellectual Endeavor whatsoever and so having the conscious channeling uh having entities like hatan uh uh lytos latui uh bringing that more loving more uh

**[13:18]** what What's the word uh gentle in a lot of ways uh take on these ideas um it's it's very it puts it in the right context so that then you can take this information that raw is transmitted and in a lot of ways you can apply it to your life without having to uh translate it to yourself hmm yeah I can see that I can see that I'm just thinking of the last the last

**[13:51]** session that I recorded again I think it was October 31st in 76 and I thought to myself at the end of it when they first when I first started reading through the transcripts it was almost hard to keep going I'm like this is this is kind of boring and I know you know there's there's another um content creator Brian Scott with the reality Revolution and every now and

**[14:19]** then he will do just a transcript reading of a quo transcript and and I thought to myself okay here I am at the beginning well it's not the beginning but in 74 okay at least when they started recording these transcripts and the message is X and I can see where they're at with the kuo material and that's why and I'm like okay there's got to be some gradation of quality that just increases you know where this has to turn a quarter

**[14:49]** but um but yes it uh you know in the in the in 1974 they were doing a lot of sessions or at least they were writing a lot of transcripts but the messages were so simple and honestly a little bit not not clear it was constantly seek meditate and then understand through service that was essentially it and if you didn't know what seeking meant well too bad yet you gotta wait because that that explanation is just coming later you

**[15:19]** know meditate I mean it's kind of self you know it meditation is meditation but they do explain that a little bit better and then understand okay what does understanding mean you know it was just challenging to to go through but but the more I go through it the farther along that I get yeah the messages are just they're just solid you know lately it's been uh in October at least the theme has really been

**[15:47]** the the function of of suffering or the function of what what hatan calls tribulations well what we call tribulations you know and the fact that if you can see the love in those challenges um you know you're you're well on your path you you're well on the path if you can if you can see that love so um yeah but it's been it's just been so interesting to see these develop and I'm

**[16:15]** and I'm excited to keep pushing and seeing what level are they at when they tip that corner and they they start to channel raw um you know I'm interested to see is that was that definitely a wow this is next level or was it just a necessary step in the ever moving Journey forward you know and and I don't want to spoil the surprise for you but but I will say that uh uh it's also interesting not just to see the build up too Rob but the conscious channeling as they're in the

**[16:44]** process of jailing raw they're still running uh you know Saturday or Sunday meditations they're still bringing in um hatan and latui um they are still keeping their chops up uh they're not just uh relying because you know uh one of the things that's different about the conscious channeling versus unconscious channeling we should probably get into that um is in the Raw contact for the vast majority of this session Carla is

**[17:13]** unconscious there is an elaborate ritual that is developed that's uh transmitted by raw to the group in order to uh sanctify and tune things for the special nature of Ra's uh contact process um and but they're still doing conscious channelings and if people who have uh studied the law of one in depth might remember a moment that they talk about

**[17:43]** in The Rock contact where Carla almost slipped away in a conscious meditation and it has to do with the nature of the conscious versus unconscious which is not real it's much more of a spectrum right it's it's a gradation it is not a clear line and a lot of what the protocols are about is keeping those lines clear because once you are in the flow of channeling the whole point is to keep

**[18:10]** your tuning high so that you can say whatever comes to mind so what are you tuning is your control it's the only control you have so this is this is uh one of the okay this is step one in our journey together because I think I've asked you this before and I still I still struggle with the definition but what do you mean by tuning and I have heard this before that you have to tune yourself or tune yourself to a higher vibration so you can you know I don't know what it means exactly

**[18:38]** there was a great uh hatan or maybe it was Axel uh that you recorded recently that talked about think of yourselves as a harps yes you don't get to change the way that the wind blows through you sometimes it flows hot sometimes it flows cold sometimes it flows hard sometimes it's gentle the only thing that you have control over is your tuning whether how that how you interact with that wind

**[19:07]** to express yourself and to express the Creator same thing so the idea is is to work on the discipline of the personality another rock on Raw contact concept working on your discipline in order to know yourself better to once you know yourself in a fundamental way uh Catalyst and different things that come

**[19:36]** up in your life are not threats in the same way that they are when you're an unknown quantity and you are afraid that anything that might happen in life might expose something about yourself that you don't understand and that's what creates in my opinion all the tension understanding yourself on a basic level your flaws your strengths uh where you come from and perhaps a certain level of acceptance of Who You Are

**[20:06]** well that gets into uh raw so raw basically made it very succinct right know yourself accept yourself become the Creator hmm so tuning is a way to know is the result of knowing and accepting yourself and becoming the Creator because you have made a conscious dedication of your mind and your heart uh to a higher purpose than the mundane things that we busy

**[20:35]** ourselves with uh in day-to-day life okay it's kind of like um getting yourself in a headspace you can think of it that way and then like of course there the the tuning does imply a vibrational component there's no doubt about that uh it's important to understand that the Confederation sees everything as vibration yes okay so let me put it back in the way I understand it and see if I'm getting close

**[21:04]** tuning is essentially understanding yourself perhaps understanding how you're going to react to the Winds of Change for example um and I'm guessing that understanding is one thing but putting in putting into the putting into practice is really where the tuning comes in I would imagine that okay I can understand myself but if I still react

**[21:32]** if I still go off the wall when um when the garbage isn't taken out on Tuesday and the garbage man comes on on Wednesday morning you know that's I would imagine that uh you know knowing something understanding something and then putting it into practice there's got to be a a correlation there or a uh you know what I'm saying you know what I'm getting yeah okay yeah I think um you know uh psyching yourself up for something is a

**[22:00]** kind of tuning uh hate reading uh your Twitter feed or your Facebook feed and looking at all the wrong people that is that's a kind of tuning what we're talking about are actions that you take to affect the change in Consciousness in yourself it's right next door to Magic and and uh ritual magic in the sense that you are making yourself a certain kind of vessel you're you can be a vessel for anything

**[22:27]** you want there are tons of signals coming into into us from the universe at any given moment more than we can ever pick up on tuning is a way that you find the subset the band that you're interested in and the idea is is that our experience if it's understood less as this uh weird phenomenon that we wake up go through and then it ends every day uh in

**[22:57]** our sleep but instead as this kind of uh song is this kind of tone that is always going on and we get to choose which part of that we tune into which channel we're on right uh that's what tuning is and the idea is that as we get to know ourselves better we know when we're in tune and we have an idea of what kind of tune we're interested in what kind of tuning we're

**[23:25]** interested in I just had a thought as far as tuning and maybe how I've changed since I've you know since I've grown out of my 20s I'm 37 now but I'm sure in my in my earlier days I was with my son on um on Saturdays we go to a place here in town it's just it's like we call it the the meat the sausage store because they got these great in-house made sausages and pepperonis and once we're out my two-year-old son we cannot go back to my

**[23:53]** truck until we sit down and we eat a pepperoni stick so we're sitting there eating a pepperoni each of us have got a nice pepperoni stick and um and I can see from down the block the sky is coming towards this guy's walking towards us and he's got this super happy dog and I can see I can see this play out in my head I'm like that dog is going to take my son's pepperoni stick and I see that and I didn't do anything to stop it but from a whole block away I see this guy nonchalantly come up you

**[24:22]** know and his dog happy as ever and that dog once he got a whiff of that pepperoni stick he just jumped he just took it right from Emmett and I immediately felt terrible for the guy because I'm like oh no his dog ate my kids pepperoni stick what if his dog has like colitis or what if his dog can't has that special diet and I'm like oh my gosh sir I'm so sorry he's looking at me

**[24:51]** like I'm crazy like what I my dog just took your kid's pepperoni stick you know but but I remember coming away from that experience thinking that I wonder you know you put a different person in that situation a different person sitting down maybe a person who's who's frustrated and angry and the only thing they have in this world is that Saturday with their kid eating a pepperoni stick and when someone else comes up and their dog snatches it that might not be a good experience you

**[25:20]** know that might have been a very different reaction but I but I thought about that it's like huh it's funny that guy felt terrible but I felt terrible as well for him and for his dog you know but it just it made me think of I wish I could feel that way about everything that I do just concerned about how others are doing you know can making you know making sure they're happy and taken care of and you know I wish I could feel that

**[25:49]** way more often certainly trying but um but it was just a clear moment like huh that's what it feels like to uh to be to be zeroed in to be tuned in on on uh you know caring for the well-being or you know uh trying to meet the expectations of someone else but um yeah and it's a good example of uh how service actually plays out in the real world too um because it often is a surprise if it

**[26:17]** does uh really show somebody something different something loving that they didn't expect uh that's a little bit of service that's a little bit of uh clueing them in to you know there's a mystery out there and we all live our lives uh in a very civilized world where risk and uh tentative things are tried we try to minimize them as much as possible and so to show somebody

**[26:46]** something that they don't expect that's positive and loving when they expected to be uh scolded or something like that those are the kinds of things that plant seeds in people that that it doesn't mean that they uh they love you and they uh appreciate you and they turn their whole lives around what it means is that it is it has the possibility of starting their own seeking process yes and they

**[27:13]** are the are the drivers yes and we have to be okay with that I think planting the seed that's we're gonna have to save that for another and maybe episode two but that's been a that was at least a consistent theme in uh September October of 76 was planting the seed and that's it's a great visualization and a great a great lesson but uh we'll have to save that for later but I want to go back because I I kind of pulled you away from where you were going with tuning you were starting to go into conscious

**[27:41]** channeling and the tuning of the instruments and then I cut you off with the question so can you get back into that when you're doing the conscious when they're doing the conscious channeling and there's a tuning aspect that goes into the actual experience of of conscious channeling well I don't know exactly how they did this stuff in 74-76 all that in fact I'm

**[28:09]** not sure that there's anybody there may be people who are still alive who participated in those sessions but I'm not aware of them and they'd be impossible to track down because this was before Jim McCarty got involved in yellow research yes right yes um but the what Carla was able to develop and she wrote about this a little bit in her channeling handbook uh is that you need to

**[28:37]** like Ross says uh ritual magic is or magic is the ability to affect changes in Consciousness at will we all experience changes in Consciousness the idea is what if you could be uh in control of that instead of just having your mood swings and the things that like throw you off or like get you on the path instead of those things just happening to you you create a space and a time where uh you can tell your Deep

**[29:06]** Mind okay that was mundane experience but now we're doing something special we're doing something different and I really rely upon you so I am creating a means of communication between my deep mind and my conscious mind where we have a relationship and the way to do this I mean this this actually um is a lot like uh oh what do they call it a neuro-linguistic programming yeah kind

**[29:35]** of the same thing uh you are creating triggers for yourself um in order to put yourself in a space where you can reliably be of a different Consciousness or tuning mood however you want to say it I can relate with to this in in multiple ways one that comes to mind is is my dad he uh I grew up with a small business owner he has a fence company he had a fence company

**[30:04]** and he put my brother and I to work at a very young age and I did not I thought I knew my dad and then I saw him at work as the boss with everything on the line he's responsible for the success of the business which is responsible for our family's well-being and all of his employees family's well-being so he feels like he's carrying a lot of weight and at work I mean talk about an object

**[30:31]** example of Yin and Yang or night and day where you know he was completely different he walked into that office and it was game on it was it was it was wild to experience but I think it was my first experience of what people are capable of when you do when you do this when you create a space for yourself and you're like okay I need to have this attitude or this Focus or whatever it is when I'm here and then when I go over here to this other place

**[31:00]** I can I can relax a bit or I can change the focus you know so yeah I think that's what a lot of people are having problems with in the pandemic is that going to an office is a trigger to yourself that now I'm in work mode going home is a trigger that now I'm in rest mode and no we don't have those uh triggers anymore yeah so we're always working or we're never working yeah I know I have that problem yeah me too

**[31:27]** me too yeah my wife my wife and I try to hang out at night you know but she's always asking do you have work and I'm like yes my office is right there I've always got work to do it it's hard to it's hard to shut it off you know so yeah I hear you I hear you um boy gosh where do we go from here there's like the whole world you know there's so many different directions we can go well I think that maybe uh following the

**[31:57]** tuning uh topic into the nature of channeling in general yeah it might be useful for somebody who for whom uh this they're used to like a medium at a psychic uh a place where like you know you pay some money and they like Channel your like dead grandma like Cleo like I just remember Cleo on TV yeah yeah and I think I think that uh is a

**[32:24]** completely legitimate uh skepticism to have 100 um there is a lot of uh there are a lot of people out there who are frauds um there's no doubt about it there's also a lot of people for whom relating to others and trying to help them through some alternative means might even be like a positive thing that they're trying to do even though they're kind of like pretending to be somebody else or something like sure uh I don't it's not something I would necessarily approve of

**[32:53]** if anybody's asking for my approval but like you can there is a service element to in other words adopting another identity for the purposes of service in other words you can tune yourself to anything but the purpose for the tuning has a lot to do with how you achieve it right and the quality of it okay so I think of channeling as um playing on the principle that identity

**[33:22]** our identities as people as individuals it's really not as fixed a thing as we'd like to think our egos our personalities they're real and they're there but they're not as the the lines are not very uh thick we can go we we all have had the experience of feeling like a different person we've all heard voices that we maybe don't recognize as ourselves and

**[33:51]** yet they very much are and see part of ourselves maybe competing on a on a choice that we have to make or something like that uh I see the whole concept of channeling and I think this is very in line with the Confederation philosophy uh as being one of uh identity is mutable and therefore because our thoughts are not as restricted to ourselves as we think they

**[34:19]** are the real nature of thought is that it is a pool in which we all dip uh it's not our little kiddie pool it's actually a gigantic pool um that whether or not we're talking from a confederation identity or some other Identity or our own identity is those are all valid ways of expressing the Creator and so when we tune all we're trying to do is uh tune

**[34:48]** into a specific like character of what is always and ever the same Creator the same self the same uh unending uh uh array and spectrum of Consciousness and uh creator creatorship so would that mean that that as you as you're tuning as you're tuning let's say as you're just well for better for

**[35:17]** lack of a better way of me hashing this out as you're trying to raise your vibration as you're trying to really fine tune does that mean that you essentially if you're able to achieve that do you you essentially become exposed to or perhaps have access to a different idea different pool of ideas you know if it's if it's one conscious pool of how did you put it you put it very well it's not we have what is it you're

**[35:46]** dipping into a pool of Consciousness yeah a thought yeah um so well I think the best way for uh a listener to get to the bottom of this is for them to explore it themselves for them to meditate to quiet their mind which is a hard thing to do in and of itself it takes practice you're not going to do it perfectly when you first start keep doing it that's the only the Confederation never said that you had to

**[36:15]** meditate well they just say try they even that they even starting point they even say you can you don't have to meditate long that even a few seconds or a few minutes is enough if you're you know it what's just important is that you do it that you write that time but clear your mind take when you have some time to do so clear your mind and then observe yourself observe the observe the nature of thought observe

**[36:44]** the nature of your own thinking one of the things that uh hatan has put a very fine point on that I had forgotten about in listening to the 70s messages uh is oh crap I just lost it um foreign

**[37:12]** so you're dipping into this pool uh you're meditating oh yeah um the only way that we we cannot consciously analyze ourselves they say that that is impossible and I think that uh the history of psychology and Psychotherapy demonstrate that very well that you do need some other party involved to be able to have anything close to an objective view of your of

**[37:40]** your of your cognitive conscious uh processes well getting into a slightly different attitude of Mind a slightly different quote-unquote identity by just observing what goes on in your head as you try not to think of anything you're going to see the nature of thought and uh the Buddhists have Millennia of teaching and frankly like you know

**[38:07]** practices and Technologies for understanding this they understand very clearly that you know the mind is kind of just going on its own inertia it's just going to keep generating stuff this is where our ego and our personalities come from this need to keep up with this constant they call it discursive thought right this chatter that we have with ourselves oh yes and so the the idea is to Simply observe that to see what the nature of

**[38:35]** thinking is and then you you can start to have some agency in uh participating in it more consciously right how would you describe because I I realized when I started meditating a year and change ago um what did I say March of last year so has it really only been like one year that I've been meditating but I think it took me a couple maybe even a couple months

**[39:03]** I'm just that dense of of understanding what meditation is or like how to do it I mean you come into it okay you come into it not knowing anything about meditation and the first the question you ask is well how do I meditate and when somebody says oh you just sit there and you just you try to empty your mind that's it you're like that's it that doesn't make sense but but that is what it is but how would you I mean how would you describe it for

**[39:31]** someone coming in new coming in cold who wants to start experiencing this who wants to start meditating what's a simple way to get started uh yeah uh first of all apologies for my beagle seems like he's excited about something um so again I I would I would prefer anybody interested to uh Buddhist thought uh I believe it's Pima shodron uh talked about her teacher and how when

**[40:00]** uh trungpo rimpos first came to America and set up uh asanga and and started teaching people had a very hard time meditating in the way that Buddhists talk about of clearing your mind because it's hard it's it's kind of like don't think of a pink elephant right oh yeah life's right there you can't do that right like you always have to have an object to think about and that's kind of how we think of our own minds um

**[40:29]** so what he said he's changed his uh instructions from don't think about anything clear your mind completely and said uh concentrate on your breath have a very very light touch of concentration and attention on your breath that gives you something to hold on to that feels like you're holding on to it but very very quickly you'll find out that you're not really paying attention to your breath you're really not paying attention to anything that's a shortcut

**[40:57]** that the Buddhists came up with that I think works really well that's a great point because I just thought there was a every now and then they will the Confederation in the channel and the conscious channelings will give meditation lessons or essentially channeling tips to the you know to the group members and I do remember a couple or at least one in particular where hatan is saying that you sit there you know the idea is to focus on nothing but like you've just said it's near

**[41:25]** impossible so if you if you think if you remove all thoughts except for one and let's let that one be your breathing and then then just as you said you'll notice yeah you're not thinking of anything and that's you know and his thoughts come in yeah but you know recognize it Let It Go that's the important thing that I that kept me from meditating regularly for a long time is that I thought if thoughts entered then that meant I wasn't doing it right and I eventually gave up

**[41:54]** because hey I can't stop thinking about stuff but that's I realized uh when uh reading some of these Buddhist people that's the completely wrong attitude uh the idea is that uh the way they describe it is that the mind is a blue sky clouds sometimes come across the sky and then they go away this is their metaphor for the nature of thought thoughts come in thoughts go

**[42:20]** away and you are keeping your Center and and your uh position of observation fixed so that you can learn that you are not compelled by any thought you are the bastard the thoughts are not the master and if the thoughts come in then you you acknowledge them and you and you let them go and as you get used

**[42:48]** to seeing things come in even things that really disturb you and letting them go you start to get used to the idea that thought is not something that is happening to you it is something that you participate in you are not compelled by any thoughts and you can have this more gentle relationship with yourself where you then can start to do things like

**[43:15]** discipline the personality to be uh ready for certain highly tuned apps when you want to when you want to mm-hmm mm-hmm yeah that'd be a good skill to have I think what what well believe it or not it wasn't even the law of one that got me into meditation I think it was a Joe Rogan podcast and he was I think it was this was probably the fourth or fifth time I had heard a similar uh thought

**[43:45]** from a from one of his guests but they basically said they had they were having better ideas once they learned how to calm down that constant chatter in their mind they were able to just have clearer ideas better ideas I'm like I want that you know my gosh that would be great so maybe I'll maybe I'll try to learn this thing but um but it has been helpful I think and one interesting idea that I keep coming across that is it's slowly simmering is in the Confederation material

**[44:15]** every now and then hatan will say you know the the the instrument is questioning whether or not these are his thoughts but then they'll correct and say well yes these are his thoughts and they are also our thoughts because they're the same thoughts you know because we are all one and we all have you know it's just this very interesting idea that kind of goes back into tuning you know if you if you're trying to live on a certain on a certain level dare I say that because I don't you know

**[44:44]** as a connotation of in our culture of like judgment like oh I have a higher vibration than you which is is upsetting but anyway um when you're when you're tuning to that certain level yeah I'm really interested what type of thoughts become available how does your outlook slowly but surely shift or change or what insights do you have about you know your experiences with others or

**[45:11]** you know what I'm saying yeah the the the the metaphor I'd use is think of what you used to think about when you were like six or eight years old right that was still you yes but completely different concerns a completely different there you couldn't even enumerate the different the ways of difference right like it's uh it that's that that is why tuning is an act that you take uh in

**[45:39]** order to give yourself kind of like to spit to sort of dilate the time to to to provide yourself a threshold over which to cross so that you are in a different state of mind um and then uh when you're in this different state of mind uh you will have different thoughts I don't care how you establish that different state of mind or even what your tuning is uh once you have I mean think about

**[46:09]** when something uh surprises you and how time just comes like if you get in a car accident or something like that time to stand still right and it's almost like everything sometimes everything happens in slow motion these are changes in Consciousness that are occurring to US based on some catalytic uh uh action or some event that occurs to us the idea is to participate in that more consciously by taking the time to do so

**[46:37]** and then to open yourself up in that uh more refined State of Consciousness that you uh discover and once you do open yourself up you will notice that you have a quality of thought that is completely different now it may not be that you need to channel that right like that's that's a whole different thing because there's a there's a responsibility that comes with speaking the words that come to your mind when you're claiming to be in a different

**[47:05]** state right like that that becomes an issue of a Duty that you have uh to lots of different uh uh uh interests but um yeah I later on in uh Confederation instruction on channeling uh they make it very clear that they want a mix they do not want normally to have 100 fidelity

**[47:34]** to their message transmitted through a channel they ask for a 70 30 mix I believe it's 70 them and 30 us remember uh the whole service of channeling is taking these highly refined thoughts pure and on a completely different level of reality than we experience in trying to find some way to project them into a limited reality if they

**[48:03]** could do that on their own they would and they need us to translate it's almost like think of it as a Step Down Transformer in a power grid you are taking that high voltage it's very powerful and it needs to be powerful in order to go long distances but once it gets to your house you don't need that power you need to step it down so it's useful in a lot of ways what you're trying to do as a channel is you're trying to step down their thoughts into

**[48:30]** concrete words and that in and of itself is enough of a discipline and task that uh nobody on in the Confederation expects us to transmit their ideas with 100 Fidelity in fact a very common experience of channels is when they come out when the session's over and they're in there chatting they're like ah I left so much of their thoughts so much of their message on the table that I

**[48:59]** couldn't transmit that is a constant refrain of channels that's interesting because Carla used to say that see I didn't know that until I just got well then you told me but um that pings that resonates with me because there was a session not too long ago that I were I mean in the 70s but at least with what I recorded um where there's a channel who goes by H and H at the end of it they caught the recording so it made on made it onto the

**[49:28]** transcript but H is saying that you know he it went by so fast he just had to there was so much he just had to go with it and leave like just like what you said you had to leave it on the table and he was describing the feelings of love or the the concept of love that he was getting uh yes or maybe it's a she I don't know if H is a he or she but me either but um but that's but that's fascinating yeah I mean how do you you know

**[49:56]** they say that they they deliver Concepts to the channel and then it is up to the channel to filter those Concepts through their own understanding their own ideas their own language and skill sets into something verbal and they're constantly saying that verbal language is is terrible terrible for communicating you're forgetting up you're getting across the entire all the ideas and and you wrote a great essay that I don't think you've published yet about about verbal communication you

**[50:25]** know yeah but um but one thing um I think it's even early on I think it's in session one of the raw material raw when they when when raw Pops in they say weird I meant I'm gonna butcher this but we want to provide another you know a somewhat different slant on information that is always the same always and every the same and I you will come across that in other in other

**[50:54]** channel material with other other entities that that the message is the same the words can be different depending on Whose Channel and I think my wife even asked me about this it's like why is it that why is it uh well oh boy I'm gonna digress hugely if I go down that path so I won't do it but uh but but my response to her was essentially the same thing you know the same thing that wherever these messages come from it's always being filtered

**[51:24]** through your brain and whatever is in your brain um at that time so it's I might also add that one of the constant uh admonitions of the Confederation is for the listener or the reader to use their own discrimination and I think that's an important reason uh I I think that uh the fact that the channel does participate to some extent

**[51:51]** in the message alone that makes it important to not ascribe Authority to these messages right like you have to take responsibility for your own learning and you can't just like you know let raw or or some other you know uh entity uh live your life for you like it's up to you and um when you decide I really resonate with that idea yeah

**[52:19]** that's not really for me like you also are doing a kind of channeling in the sense that you are discriminating and translating a generalized message to your specific to the application of your individual life and hey that's a part of seeking is trying to figure out how to take all these ideas all these feelings um and figure out how to live a human life with all of it right yeah I think that's

**[52:47]** huge that's huge and you can even get a sense of that what you've just pinpointed you can get a sense of that in some of the some of the early sessions there's one in particular when I think that it's relatively new in the game when they're doing question and answer with hatan and I think Dawn asks hatan what happened he says what happened to the pilot in Australia you know there's a there is a there's an event where a pilot

**[53:17]** um basically disappeared I think it was off the co it was either I'm I'm sorry it's either Australia or Florida I know those are very different but that's what's in my mind a pilot I not only know this because I because I googled this later and on week or at least Wikipedia if that's a valid source but a pilot disappeared and there was supposedly perhaps like a UFO sighting you know along with it and Don asked what happened with the pilot and I think he phrased the question so that

**[53:46]** the answer would go to Don Carla and there was a third meditator a third Channel there as well but they all got different answers I think Don got say like the the uh that he that he died you know they tried to do something and he died Carla said that they abducted him or you know and then the third guy got it it was all a little bit a little bit different you know so it's like huh okay something happened with the pilot but everyone's getting a different

**[54:16]** impression as far as you know and there might be truth in each of those it might be it perhaps it's a concept that encompasses somewhat each of them but it can be interpreted in a different way maybe he died during an abduction event or maybe it was maybe something deeper I mean you know yes there's another possibility here right okay that somebody's just wrong right oh yes and that it is in the raw

**[54:46]** material in the Raw contact that they really articulate this with a lot of clarity and helpful Fidelity to this concept they say that the more transient the questions and information sought are right the more it deals with the mundane the the Fantastic details of day-to-day life like oh where do UFOs come from uh you know uh asking questions about like specific details of when an earth change might happen or what happened to this

**[55:15]** pilot the more detailed it becomes in our experience our kind of tuning that we all are in in order to uh be in a society right that's a tuning right that we're all in the more it gets to that and the more it gets away from the Timeless information from the philosophical information that will be the same in this civilization and in a civilization ten thousand years from now right uh the the farther it gets away from

**[55:44]** that raw said that the information becomes distorted interesting because you're having to do more of that translation huh interesting I mean that's my take is that you're doing more of the translation uh sure and there's all these expectations wrapped up on it it wrapped up in it um the more that it sticks to the philosophical Timeless stuff uh the more likely it is that you don't have like some sort of like human interest in it

**[56:12]** so you're not trying it's not that you're trying to distort the information so there's nothing to distort with right because you don't have an interest in you know how many octaves there are or like you know uh uh uh what the nature of six density is like or any of these or what the nature of love is like right like you can you can leave these things in a more mysterious uh setting and that allows you to be a little bit more objective and a little less needing to

**[56:41]** uh put your own spin on things just to make it articulable right that's uh that's a great point that's a great point I do enjoy when when in the middle of a of a session they have to change channels because for example they're trying to give geographical information through Carla but Carla's terrible geography sort of like sorry about this or at least she says when she's channeling she's like

**[57:10]** this instrument is terrible at geography and you know but um yeah always so interesting to just to just read these read these messages and take the what is the right word all of the thoughts all of the ideas that we've just outlined the fact that humans are fallible there's this you know 70 30 concept of of information

**[57:39]** from the Confederation and then 30 from the channel um the translation of Concepts and ideas it's I'm thinking at least when I'm reading the sessions and I'm recording those sessions I'm thinking of that all the time because they're again they're great messages you know but maybe it goes back to that base that base level take what resonates with you and discard the rest because you know what I we've talked about this before

**[58:07]** if you come across a hard-hitting truth that feels powerful to you does it matter if it came from an alien Abraham Lincoln or your next door neighbor you know it doesn't matter because an idea is an idea is an idea and if it's a powerful idea that will improve your well-being and livelihood roll with it brother just go with it and go hard amen you know go hard um

**[58:37]** yeah that's what I'm going back to again our first our first conversation you know they're there's a subtle but important difference between facts and truths and you can come across some pretty good truths and things that are not factual I mean you can take to take The Count of Monte Cristo you know a novel completely made up story and it's just packed with great lessons that someone can take you know so

**[59:07]** um but yeah it's just those are just things I think about when I'm come when I'm going through some of these sessions that uh some of the ideas in them are just they're just fantastic they are and um remember that uh when you're when you're uh sort of appraising these ideas uh that what is the purpose for the message right why is this message even purportedly being given it's not to get you a raise at work

**[59:33]** it's not uh uh make sure that you have no troubles in your life even um there is something much more important going on is about the evolution of mind body and spirit to where it's higher and higher vibrations not as a way of uh stratifying people in a society again that is a means to learning it is not the thing that we're shooting for we're shooting for becoming

**[1:00:01]** better and better versions of ourselves and participating more and more consciously in that progression of the what rock holds the upward spiraling light the more that you can participate in that consciously the more your life won't get better that's not the point the point is is that you will use the material of your life to learn more about yourself to learn more about the Creator and to uh give the Harvest of

**[1:00:29]** all of that to the Creator in a more and more pure way so that at um the whole mystery of this experience of being separate from the Creator uh yields value yeah there's something about being separate from the Creator that we wanted to explore let's use this time to do it as best as we can yeah I think in uh was it the session that was published yesterday we're recording this on April 4th so I think it was April 2nd

**[1:00:59]** or April 3rd um I believe it's a ton who's saying that you know on the other side maybe in what we would call the astral planes it's a place where our thoughts are literal things and we experience that infinite love all the time and looking in on this plane you wonder you wonder to yourself you're like if I was there with with the veil

**[1:01:28]** of forgetting and not knowing what what what truth you know what the universe really is could I pass that test could I really know the love and the understanding you know could I so why not go to school why not take that test you know test yourself see if um see if you can see if you can find it yeah it's not a uh it's not a commandment right it's an invitation

**[1:01:56]** that's what I love about that was one of the first things that Drew me to Ra's message is that for example when they're talking about how all this began and they talk in terms of uh enumerated distortions right the first Distortion they say in all the Confederation material that everything is love and everything is light but raw says no the first Distortion is Free Will yes the first Distortion is

**[1:02:23]** Free Will and love as we even in this expansive definition of love that comes after the idea that the creator has bestowed on all of us this uh free will to explore themselves as we see fit and it's our choice yes so when we that what I think people need to understand uh because they're coming from a religious background where it's all about some sort of Duty that you owe to

**[1:02:53]** some uh jealous Creator right some jealous God instead it's about uh liberating yourself um to make a full-throated uh Declaration of what you believe and to see how that plays out in the world and the best the strongest the um the purest way to State those ideas is to live your life as an example of them and then to evaluate how that works out I hear you I hear you I think again it

**[1:03:23]** was maybe yesterday's yesterday's session um hutan States it just put it brilliantly that you know the the one infinite Creator created this Infinite Creation sorry for all the created words and then in the ultimate Act of humility gave its creation the ability to remake that creation and I love that idea because you you take

**[1:03:52]** um at least my my early experience with Christianity in that you have a god an active God that cares and that is really involved in everything but is but is separate from and is always looking down upon whereas this philosophy is a bit more empowering in that we are all the Creator we are all responsible for this development and we have the power to

**[1:04:17]** create in in that's it's just um that but I just love that sentence the infinite Creator and the ultimate Act of humility gave its creation the ability to remake that creation well well I will point out that uh hatan was speculating when they said oh they weren't sure right like and that's a great example of of uh their humility in describing the Creator's humility right um it is and this is the nature of these

**[1:04:47]** entities that we are dealing with they are they are kind gentle helpful entities that are only here to give us a single message that they're willing to repeat in different ways over and over and over again over a course of 50 years of LL research it has been 50 years hasn't it that's wild yeah the rock contact was 40 years ago in January

**[1:05:13]** that is something else yeah and uh what one thing that constantly comes to my mind is just they do they do explain their challenges with time because they claim they're they're outside of our time and so that's a challenge so when they're constantly saying that very soon this will happen and very soon you're gonna you know your cycle of experience will end

**[1:05:41]** and I'm thinking very soon to me or to you because if it's to me I'm expecting like next week but that was in the 70s they were saying this stuff you know and I and I know in the in the raw material they're talking about you know this this transition being anywhere even up to 700 plus years of of well you got to dive into the raw material really unless we want to go down the third fourth fifth density Rabbit Hole of explaining that but

**[1:06:10]** but uh but just the idea of time they're outside of time they're they're trying to help uh but as you said earlier you know many times the the meditators the group they're concerned about what's going on now Earth changes and what's going on in California I think right now in 1976 they're asking a lot about uh what's going to happen as far as Earth changes and and uh maybe tectonic shifts in California and elsewhere and um

**[1:06:40]** the higher message though is love you know they'll get into the nitty-gritty every now and then but they'll say but what they keep repeating is is love you know love and understanding and in some of the uh uh session transcripts even in the Rock contact you can if you're if you're looking for it you can detect a little bit of consternation on their part sometimes having to answer this like detailed information that isn't uh

**[1:07:09]** pertinent to the main thrust of their message yes I think I think I think that's Charming you know yes I I loved how in the um throughout all of the raw contact they're very good about not asking they don't direct they let Dawn do the questioning except in episode one they asked the most leading questions you know and I love it I just love it um

**[1:07:39]** they give a coaching session in the in the first session you know yeah there is one other area in the Raw contact where they make a specific request uh that they insist on and it has to do with this uh unpublished healing material that is outside of the bounds of the any of the published stuff um but with that exception uh they yeah they've been an open book interesting

**[1:08:08]** interesting wow so I think we've been at this for I know we started recording earlier but I'm at uh 120. yeah that's about where I'm at too we want to hit anything else before uh before we sign off let's see well I think that they're for me personally it's important that people approach the subject of channeling uh in a way uh that

**[1:08:36]** is is inclined to see it less as some exotic uh undertaking and more as uh one example of a more General principle you mind if I go no I'm really interested in this because if I can preface this I'm not the type of person that believes in uh in Magic you know I I think there are rules we might not understand the rules of the universe all the time but there

**[1:09:05]** are rules and I believe in um replicability if someone can do it anyone else can do it so long as they follow the same process as follows it you know so I'm very interested in this um and I know I've asked you before how do you do this is it hard you know so I would love to get your take on Pardon Me In channeling in general yes uh so

**[1:09:34]** um the idea is that we I I've said before that uh when you tune yourself or when you get in a different mindset or when the world puts you in a different mindset uh different thoughts occur to you different feelings uh uh announce themselves within you and in a way you're kind of a different person uh so I feel that uh channeling is just this very very articulated version of

**[1:10:03]** that where we have put out a call to an entity that we purport to be there um and then we become receptive that is basically all it is in fact um as somebody who has done a little tiny bit of channeling I'm not by any means an expert but I have uh gone through a little bit of ll's uh uh uh training uh the closest thing that I can

**[1:10:31]** find to it is like what the Quakers do in their meetings where everybody just sits in silence and then when someone feels moved they stand up and they speak it's very much like that and if you if you look at it this less exotic authoritative way and more as um just becoming a different version of yourself a one that's more focused on helping and more attuned to the best and highest within yourself then that identity doesn't really matter so much

**[1:11:01]** because it's about the information and so a lot of what the Confederation talks about uh in their messages to us is uh getting out of our own way to a certain extent if we can tune ourselves to give our highest and best in normal life then aren't we to a certain extent channeling even when we go to the grocery store and we we uh run you know

**[1:11:30]** run into somebody else uh accidentally and we use as an opportunity to to to apologize and show them love to the best that we can we're opening up that channel from the high on uh uh to allow us to manifest our best and highest in a very Fallen uh frustrating limited World um it you know uh oh man there's so many ways like places I could go with this

**[1:11:59]** but Jeremy do you think I pause because you you told me this and it was just so clear I love the way you articulated this and you're gonna have to rehash this because I'm not gonna do it well something about service the concept of service is just channeling is that it is that uh bringing uh bringing your highest and best to every situation and putting a finer and finer

**[1:12:28]** point on that through your practice of meditation through your discipline and personality to understand yourself better to understand your triggers and your faults and your strengths so that you can make all of that available to the Creator I there's a there's something that hatan says about letting love live your life recognizing that you're not you as a limited conscious veiled individual are not going to win this right yeah first of all you have to get

**[1:12:58]** out of the idea that it's a it's a contest at all but I I grant I grant that all of us if we're thinking about this as an intellectual exercise the living of Our Lives to our best Advantage uh we're going to approach it that way and you all of the Confederation is saying all they're saying is that there's another option available try it on see how you like it and I believe that like for example this

**[1:13:26]** is the deeper message of Jesus too which is to be receptive to the Creator and to let your actions in the even the hard situations be a way of the Creator reaching and and and showing love in the particular ways in phenomenal reality that only we will be in a position to do right uh Confederation entities say you know we can't get involved in the day-to-days of

**[1:13:54]** of human life you are our boots on the ground you are the ones that have to make yourselves available to the Creator and let that higher vibration step down into that lower vibration where it does just the right thing in a way that you can't possibly evaluate or even know if you're doing right sure and that's where faith comes in I think of it as um if you've ever heard of that story from

**[1:14:22]** the 1900s or 1800s uh I think it's called flat world it's about it's a story about two-dimensional entities like two-dimensional big about this and they get visited by a sphere and they're fascinated that when the sphere passes through the plane that they live on the circle that the two-dimensional people see gets bigger and smaller um what we are doing is we are trying to step down and project from a much more

**[1:14:50]** like uh High vibration uh all-encompassing totalizing loving place that we all come from and we all at some level recognize and remember we are trying to remind people through our actions not through preaching to them but through our actions through being an example that's what Jesus did he set an example and you too will do these things that I do and what he did that was important wasn't the Miracles

**[1:15:20]** it was the love yes it was how he inspired people yes and the Confederation is very adamant that we there is no reason that any of us cannot follow in the Master's footsteps and do these things ourselves in the way that matters in the way that only we as unique portions of the Creator can do we are completely Irreplaceable there is a take that we have on truth beauty love that only we can provide to the world

**[1:15:49]** and all we have to do is get uh our personalities to become more and more transparent to the light that's all already shining through I still love that's already coming through us we just need to get a little bit more out of its way than we did before and that is a that's a that is a beautiful and inspiring way for anybody to live regardless of what you believe in he definitely definitely they do hit that often that

**[1:16:17]** Jesus lived by example and perhaps where Christianity might focused on focus on why he died the Confederation focuses on how he lived and I do love that and there's there's an idea I've been I've been trying to work through that that uh I put a lot of faith in that idea that whatever Jesus did when when he was here on Earth the Miracles if we want to call him that

**[1:16:46]** all of that is possible and I say that because the the Confederation says all of that is possible if you understand what Jesus understood and that is we are We Are All One the same the same old law of one we are all one we are all the Creator we are all Brothers um I am I just give you my love it I didn't heal you if that was the creator that was you know that was

**[1:17:14]** it's not magic you know but I I'm starting to put Faith in that because you go on YouTube and just just check out some near-death experience stories just check out a few of them you don't even have to do many because so many of them are the same yeah and what blows me away is for so many when they when they go to the other side when they pass away they go to the other side they experience most of them not all of

**[1:17:43]** them most of them experience unfathomable love Infinite love they get a taste of what that is like and most of them don't want to come back to earth but they get pushed back to Earth and when they come back life is hard they usually have to recover I mean they did die you know they got to recover but something's different about them that Veil is thinned they have more they tend to have more

**[1:18:11]** psychic abilities um weird things happen to them they can feel People's Energy a bit more their their their thought the weirdest things happen to people who get a little taste of that unconditional unfathomable infinite love and so I'm starting to you know I'm starting to put two and two together so to speak that perhaps that is that is true that the way that Jesus lived was meant to be by example that it's not about how he died it's about

**[1:18:40]** how he lived and if we could come to terms with that if we could ReDiscover that perhaps we too could be could be um able to achieve what he achieved um but that was just one connection I made with you know people who've uh who've passed away and come back and the the similarity of their stories but just the fact that yeah they get one taste of that that infinite love what they you know what they they think of as God or some of them even run into Jesus you

**[1:19:09]** know they say so um I want to experience that I don't want to die but I would love to experience that that feeling of infinite love I wish I could wish I could tap into that I'm not sure if that's something that just that would take practice or exercise or more meditation but if that exists out there I would love to search that out and experience it you want to see the teacher's answer sheet you caught me you caught me Jeremy I do I do too

**[1:19:39]** I totally do but it's it's totally possible um it is it is completely within our ability to do that and I think as we go through these messages more and more not only will we discover uh more clearly what that means but we may even start to change and The Listener may start to change uh their ideas about uh uh what that entails right hmm

**[1:20:07]** like what what is living a good life may be different than we thought it is right it may be it may have different uh uh things that we emphasize rather than what Society or our parents told us and like these are all this is this is a this is where I really um this is my hobby force in the law of one is uh that I think that a spirit of curiosity is the most useful thing to bring to this not one of the

**[1:20:34]** like necessarily devotion or Blind Faith or like discipline in this harsh uh uh uh uh concept but instead just being curious about yourself the nature of experience and how much mystery is out there how much we don't understand and how much we partake of that uh we could participate more and more consciously and we could witness it more and more uh diligently and uh we could be there for

**[1:21:04]** each other in new and interesting and uh inspiring ways right yeah I hear you I hear you just be speaking from from my personal Journey my personal experience that it's been it's been slow but I recognize there's there hasn't been one specific moment of okay now I'm on this path now I'm over here but I've noticed that

**[1:21:36]** the more you practice for example the more you practice trying to understand where someone else is coming from the more that becomes almost a natural you know doesn't mean that frustration goes away you know when someone cuts you off doesn't mean that frustration goes away but the more you practice it the more you start it just becomes more natural and you are able to to dampen that frustrate not even dampen

**[1:22:05]** it that frustration becomes less and less um the more you practice it I mean I guess that's all that's all I can say but it's a go for it you know uh uh one of the things that raw talks about or maybe it's not raw maybe it's quo uh but they're talking about I remember I think I might have asked this question about something about suffering in animals right and they said the animals don't suffer they feel pain and they hurt but they don't suffer because they have no

**[1:22:35]** concept that the pain is wrong it's just where they're at right then oh that's that's nice and that's a lot of what causes our suffering it's not the actual thing it's our idea that it's somehow wrong and it needs to be resisted or corrected or something like that and this is an area where I have been a quite a neophyte student in looking at those moments that caused me to tighten up uh the Pima children calls it the squeeze right it's when you feel

**[1:23:04]** that initial contraction and you know everything in nature contracts when it's threatened you know you she says you touch a sea anemone and it like it it tenses up and closes up we all have that it's our part of our animal nature to re to protect the self and to react to things that we perceive as threats in this way and so I think that there was a hatan recently where they talked about you know you are you are the animals that have spirits that have discovered the spirit complex

**[1:23:33]** in third density and you are you have on a date on a moment by moment basis the choice of whether you're going to view a phenomena that occurs to you like an animal would as a Potential Threat or a potential food source or whatever you know and like you know you can intellectualize that that's essentially what you know things like capitalism or like government or you know all these things are just like ways of trying to stabilize and make us comfortable sure or you can look at it like a spirit and

**[1:24:01]** see the wind blowing through everything that's making it all resonate in these different ways and where does your note fit in right hmm that's fantastic yeah that's fantastic I had a I had a thought but then it disappeared when I was listening to you um Riff on that that was great I'm just I was thinking that humans are built for suffering you know because it doesn't matter your station in life we all know we all have heard of we've

**[1:24:33]** all heard of stories or people the people who are in extreme poverty but happier than people I used to be a music teacher I used to be a uh I used to run High School percussion programs and I taught um within two years I taught it two different it just was a transition but I taught in two different school districts one um was less well-off and the other was extremely affluent and

**[1:25:01]** the problems were the same for the kids and it was just a perfect example that it doesn't matter it just doesn't matter where you're at you're you if you're at level one okay you're gonna have problems if you're at level two if you're at level 10 you're gonna have problems it doesn't matter how much money you have you know within within reason it doesn't matter your health it it matters your choices and your

**[1:25:30]** attitudes about you know and I do and I love how the Confederation material can help again kind of provide a template for how you can how you can view that you know how you can make better choices or at least analyze what is happening um still fleshing out that idea but it's it's uh it was just a very a very good lesson personally because you know when you're I was a music teacher I'm not making a whole lot you know I personally

**[1:25:59]** was struggling and you know here I am almost 15 years later in a much better place but am I that much happier am I you know is it not a whole lot is different oddly enough yeah it's a lot about I mean we're going to explore these themes uh much more in uh subsequent episodes but it's a lot about acceptance and uh not fighting against your experience but like being where you're at and having the faith to know that

**[1:26:28]** you uh planned this pre-incarnatedly and uh you haven't put anything in front of yourself that you can't handle and it's supposed to be a challenge because it's supposed to shine a tiny candles light into what it otherwise is very dark that is the work that we are doing we are not nobody expects us to be perfect nobody expects us not to make mistakes uh what is expected is that we

**[1:26:56]** shine our lights as much as we can and we have faith that the Creator will put us in those situations where we can do the most service and learn the most about ourselves and the most about the Creator yes amen amen well I think we have been going at this long enough for today the let's give the listeners a break we'll give them a Break um we're going to try to do these weekly we're going to try to get do one of these a week what do you think

**[1:27:26]** uh if it goes as well as it did today I'm down for it yeah this was great yeah my kids been sleeping for over 90 minutes now so I think it's going to be a good afternoon at least where I'm at fantastic wonderful but Jeremy as always a pleasure chatting with you I love chatting with you about all this stuff so thank you well thank you for thank you for uh extending the invitation to participate on this podcast and thank you so much there for for doing the

**[1:27:55]** living love and light podcast it is so fantastic to find somebody who cares about that early conscious material as much as you and I do and I know that uh one of the reasons that this podcast is gonna the living love and light podcast is going to matter is just going to expose more people to this slowly over time and I think what we'll do is it will uh flesh out the confederation's message so that everybody has it's not everybody likes

**[1:28:24]** raw so everybody will have a place that they can dip in yes yes I agree I know I enjoy it I hope you know like like raw said if you help one do we not help all so I'm just happy I'm happy that I found you out of it so uh you know even if we find one more person even we're we're both winning so there and there's there's uh people out there that we should talk to um who can speak even uh from their perspective

**[1:28:51]** um on on these things uh because there's a lot of them out there and there's one that's right for a listener right definitely definitely all right sir well everyone thanks for checking in until next time this is inaudible
